You can also chat with me here! Below is a simple Python code snippet that interacts with a chatbot:

```python
# Import the chatbot library (replace 'chatbot' with the actual library you're using)
import chatbot

# Create an instance of the chatbot
my_chatbot = chatbot.ChatBot()

# Start a conversation
my_chatbot.start_conversation()

# User input
user_input = input("You: ")

# Get the chatbot's response
response = my_chatbot.get_response(user_input)

# Print the response
print("ChatBot:", response)
